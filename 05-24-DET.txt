5/25/2019 Things I did:

1. Created a Github account and installed Github deskop on all my devices.

2. read_file.py
	* Reading a file and printing its contents.

3. copy_to_file.py 
	* Reading a file and appending its contents to a second file.
	
4. user_input_to_file.py
	* Requesting input from a user and appending to a file.
	
	
What I want to do next:

- Append values/lines to a CSV file
- Request n inputs from the user and save them as a line of a CSV file.
- Create a GUI that includes text fields for user input.
