# Lecture 1 notes

## What two things does a computer do?
- Perform calculations
- Remember results of those calculations

## What are the two types of knowledge?
- Declarative knowledge
- Imperative knowledge

## Define _declarative knowledge_
- Statement of fact 

## Define _imperative knowledge_
- Method or sequence of steps for deducing information

## Define _algorithm_
- A finite list of instructions that describe a computation that when executed on a set of inputs will proceed through a set of well-defined states and eventually produce an output.
- Includes:
    - Tests for deciding when the process is complete
    - Instructions about the order in which to execute instructions, i.e., flow control 

## Describe the differences between a _fixed-program computer_ and a _stored-program computer_
- A fixed-program computer is designed to do a single, specific task or calculation
- A stored-program computer stores and executes any valid set of instructions 

## Name the 5 parts of basic computer architecture
1. Input
2. Control Unit
3. Memory
4. Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
5. Output

## Describe _syntax_
- The order of symbols that create a well-formed expression
- Common and easily caught

## Describe _static semantics_
- Defines which syntactically valid strings have meaning
- Can cause unpredictable behavior

## Describe _semantics_
- Associates a meaning with each syntactically correct expression that has no static semantic errors
- In programming:
    - Programs crash
    - Programs run forever
    - Programs produce different answer than expected
